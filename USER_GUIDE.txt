                         User Installation Guide
================================================================================

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (PREREQUISITES):
-----------------------------------
REQUIRED:
1. Windows 10/11 (64-bit)

   Download: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
3. Python 3.11 or later (for serving frontend only)
   Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   IMPORTANT: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation!
4. The IRQ Pyrometer should have the baud rate of 9600 and same should be in the software and the device id should be in the range of  1-16. 




Installation steps. (5 MINUTES):
NOTE:- These are already configured on the CPU supplied with the system
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1: Install PostgreSQL
   - Download from: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
   - Remember your password during installation!

STEP 2: Create Database
   - Open "pgAdmin 4" (installed with PostgreSQL)
   - Right-click "Databases" → Create → Database
   - Database name: modbus_monitor
   - Click "Save"

STEP 3: Configure Backend
   - Navigate to: webpyro_backend\ folder
   - Copy ".env.production" and rename it to ".env"
   - Edit ".env" file with Notepad:
     * Replace YOUR_PASSWORD with your PostgreSQL password
     * Change CONFIG_PIN to your own 4-digit PIN

   Example:
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:admin123@localhost:5432/modbus_monitor
   CONFIG_PIN=9876

STEP 4: Configure Firewall (RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR)
   - Right-click "configure-firewall.bat" → Run as administrator
   - Click "Yes" when prompted

STEP 5: Start the Application
   - Double-click "PRODUCTION-START-MINIMAL.bat"
   - Wait for both servers to start (5-10 seconds)


ACCESS THE APPLICATION:
----------------------

From Server Computer:
   http://localhost
   or
   http://COMPUTERNAME

From Other Computers on Network:
   http://COMPUTERNAME
   or
   http://SERVER-IP-ADDRESS

To find your server IP:
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Type: ipconfig
   - Look for "IPv4 Address"


STOPPING THE APPLICATION:
-------------------------
   - Double-click "PRODUCTION-STOP.bat"
   or
   - Close both server windows manually



CONFIGURATION:
-------------
All settings in: webpyro_backend\.env

Important settings:
- DATABASE_URL: Your PostgreSQL connection
- CONFIG_PIN: 4-digit PIN for device configuration
- MODBUS_POLL_INTERVAL: Polling frequency (seconds)


DEVICE SETUP:
------------
1. Start the application
2. Open in browser: http://localhost
3. Click "Configure Devices"
4. Enter CONFIG_PIN 
5. Add your IRQ Pyrometers with:
   - Device name
   - Slave ID (Modbus address)
   - COM port (check Device Manager)
   - Baud rate (match your IRQ pyrometers)
6. Enable devices
7. Save configuration


TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------

Problem: "Backend not found" error
Solution: Make sure webpyro_backend folder exists with .exe file

Problem: Database connection error
Solution:
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running
   - Check DATABASE_URL in .env file
   - Ensure database "modbus_monitor" exists

Problem: Can't access from other computers
Solution:
   - Run configure-firewall.bat as Administrator
   - Make sure both computers are on same network
   - Try using IP address instead of computer name

Problem: Modbus devices not responding
Solution:
   - Check COM port in Device Manager
   - Verify baud rate matches device settings
   - Ensure RS485 adapter is connected
   - Check device power and connections


SUPPORT:
-------
- Check backend logs: Look at "Backend Server" window
- Check API status: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Browser console: Press F12 in browser


SECURITY NOTES:
--------------
- Change CONFIG_PIN in .env file (default: 1234)
- Use strong PostgreSQL password
- Firewall is configured for local network only
- No data leaves your local network
